### To test code:

=> cd into path/to/directory/MOPS/
=> python3 app.py

'X': switch between 'an unready setting for a snake-like game','tic-tac-toe' and 'Conways Game of Life'

Arrow keys cause movement in the totally unready snake-scenario and clicking on fields runs TTT

console prints out actual 'game parameters'

... I stopped working on that when NZ started to freak out too much, but at least the game of life is usuable for a screenloop.

All images and code are open source from now - if you see anything, just use it anywhere around the house or inside ... just wanted to write that down - do as you wish.
